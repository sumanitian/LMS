After the completion of this project i got familiar with the C programming and its features. A complete and useful library management can only be developed with lot of intensive effort and time. Due to lack of time this application is not developed in proper way there is lot of bugs. This library management application may not be must useful for library in our college but it will be the most useful for study and programming practice using C. As a whole, the project has been a good learning experience for me. I have gained knowledge about the various aspects of C programming. At the same time, I got deep understanding about the file handling in C. I still want to emphasize that the program is not complete by itself. There is still a lot of room for improvement. Graphics may be added to program to make it more attractive. The mouse cursor may be initialized in order to make the program even more interactive.
